## Introduction

The online course [From Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) is an excellent lecture about building a general-purpose computer system from the most basic building components: [NAND gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate). It is based on the book "The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles" created by the same authors, and has two major parts. Part 1 is all about the hardware they call the Hack Machine; while Part 2 goes even further: it shows how to build a two-pass compiler, where the course introduces a high-level general-purpose, object-oriented(-ish) language called the Jack language.

Though the focus of the lectures of Part 2 is building the compiler and a simplified operating system, one of the homework assignments they give you is to develop an application of your choice in Jack. This is the result of my efforts to build a raymarcher.

[Raymarching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_marching) is a class of 3D rendering methods. It fells into the cathegory of [raytracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)), a family of such methods where light rays are virtually traced through a scene to determine the color of a pixel on the screen. With raytracing you can create cool looking images with different kind of lighting, reflections, shadows, transparency, depth of field, etc. While it is not the only technique, it is essential in many areas of computer graphics and animation.
